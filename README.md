## 🛠️ How to Use / Run Examples

Follow these general steps to run any backend example folder:

1. **Navigate to a specific folder:**
   ```bash
   cd <folder-name>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the server (if an entry script exists):

bash
Copy code
npm start
or

bash
Copy code
node index.js
Use Postman, Insomnia, browser, or curl to test APIs.

🧠 Tips
✔ Use nodemon for auto reload while developing:

bash
Copy code
npm i -g nodemon
nodemon <entry-file>
✔ You can modularize routes and controllers for cleaner code.

✔ Use environment variables (.env) for storing sensitive config like database URIs.
